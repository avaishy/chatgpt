Hi Dhruv,
Good morning!

I hope you’re doing well. I had a quick question regarding DotConnector.

We recently updated a critical risk dependency to a newer version as part of remediation. However, in DotConnector, the “Last Updated” timestamp still reflects the previous date (30/06/2025), and the risk status hasn’t changed accordingly.

Could you please confirm if there’s a delay in reflecting updated dependency risks on the platform? Also, is there a way to manually trigger a refresh or check if the latest changes have been picked up?

Appreciate your help on this!
