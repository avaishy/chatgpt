I’ve prepared a short document that you can refer to while testing the LUMOS Feedback Enhancement. It explains how to give feedback and how to view Pilot Feedback and Pilot Usage.

Please note: to access the admin features, you need to be a member of the CFR_TEST_ADMIN_GROUP.
@Sai — could you please add Nick’s team to this group so they can also test the admin functionality?
