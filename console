Hi Dhruv, hope you’re doing well.

I had a quick question regarding the E3 deployment. Do we need to follow the same steps as we did for E2?

Specifically:
	•	First deploy the module on the hydra-prod-build environment using the provided RAF number and assignment group
	•	Then, trigger the GitHub action for the E3 deployment
	•	And finally, use the E1 SHA image for the deployment?

Just wanted to confirm the process with you.

Thanks!
