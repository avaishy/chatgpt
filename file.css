QA workflow is one type of follow up questions only. For follow up question, depending on routing results, it may go to three workflows:
1.	QA workflow (under src.node. chat_default_qa.py)
2.	RAG workflow (under src.node. chat_rag.py)
3.	RAG_compare workflow (under src.node.chat_rag_compare.py)

For predefined questions – require citation & reasoning
For follow-up questions, depending on workflow:
1.	QA workflow – string only, no citation & reasoning
2.	RAG workflow – require citation & reasoning
3.	RAG_compare workflow – string only, no citation & reasoning

Hope this clarifies. Thanks for the effort in making the changes promptly.
