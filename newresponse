                                    "Dan| you just touched on some of the key things to watch out for. But this is no different than us monitoring fiscal monetary policy reactions by central banks and governments. So those are all things that affect consumer sentiment| potentially affect consumer spending. So we'll just have to stay close to what that is. Our discipline around these things is to do some solid scenario planning and making sure our playbook in terms of managing our financial responsibility responsibly is up to date. Certainly| <secondary_pii_date_time> have had no shortages of such challenges| and we adapted quickly. More specifically to the points that you mentioned| elections happen regularly. So there is nothing dramatically new in <secondary_pii_date_time>. And geopolitical conflicts| they've been around| and they keep going. And that is something we'll watch what is the impact on energy prices and various downstream into the broader economy. Yet again| our Economics Institute is keeping a focus on that. So nothing very specific. That's why we kept it relatively high level. But these days| one has to just take a look left and right all the time.",
